## Project discription:
A new development in online search engine search is clarification questions, posed to to the user to clarify the information need. Using the MIMICS dataset we aim to predict the user engagement from lexical information about the query, question and answers using a neural regression model. Afterwards, we investigate whether these predicted user engagements can help in learning to rank the various possible clarification questions.
